            <h1>About SJ</h1>
            <p>
                I like cats and sunsets and semi-colons and run-on sentences 
                and songs with piano and reading books and writing in notebooks
                and javascript and html and css and spending too much time
                on my laptop and being near the ocean and the colors pink,
                orange, purple, and gray and the oxford comma and stylistic
                choices and pizza with pineapple and vanilla steamers.
            </p>
